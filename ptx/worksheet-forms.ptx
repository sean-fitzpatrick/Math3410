  <title>Worksheet: bilinear forms</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional vector space over <m>\R</m>.
      (We will use a real vector space for simplicity, but most of this works just as well for complex vector spaces.)
      Recall from <xref ref="worksheet-dual-basis"/> that a <term>linear functional</term> on <m>V</m>
      is a linear map <m>\phi:V\to \R</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can extend the idea of a linear functional to functions with more than one argument.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-bilinear">
      <statement>
          <p>
            A <term>bilinear form</term> on a vector space <m>V</m> is a function
            <me>
              \phi:V\times V\to \R
            </me>
            that is linear in each variable: for all scalars <m>a,b\in\R</m> and vectors <m>\uu,\vv,\ww\in V</m>,
            <md>
              <mrow>\phi(a\uu+b\vv,\ww) \amp = a\phi(\uu,\ww)+b\phi(\vv,\ww)</mrow>
              <mrow>\phi(\uu,a\vv+b\ww) \amp = a\phi(\uu,\vv)+b\phi(\uu,\ww)</mrow>
            </md>.
          </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Another way to put this is as follows: <m>\phi</m> is bilinear if,
      for each <m>\vv\in V</m>, the functions
      <md>
        <mrow>\eta(\ww) \amp =\phi(\vv,\ww)</mrow>
        <mrow>\psi(\ww) \amp = \phi(\ww,\vv)</mrow>
      </md>
      are both linear functionals on <m>V</m>.

    </p>

    <p>
      <alert>Caution:</alert> the bilinear form <m>\phi</m> is <em>not</em> assumed to be symmetric,
      so the linear functionals <m>\eta</m> and <m>\psi</m> defined above are (in general) different functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <term>multilinear form</term> is defined similarly, as a function of two, three, or more vector variables,
      that is linear in each variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      An example of a bilinear form is the dot product on <m>\R^n</m>.
      Given <m>\vv,\ww\in\R^n</m>, the function <m>\phi(\vv,\ww) = \vv\dotp\ww</m> defines a bilinear form.
    </p>

    <p>
      More generally, given any <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, the function
      <md>
        <mrow>\phi_A: \R^n\times\R^n \amp \to \R</mrow>
        <mrow>\phi_A(\vv,\ww) \amp = \vv^T A\ww</mrow>
      </md>
      is a bilinear form.
    </p>

    <p>
      An important example of a multilinear form is the determinant.
      Given <m>\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_n\in \R^n</m>, the function
      <md>
        <mrow>\Omega: \R^n\times\cdots \times\R^n \amp \to \R</mrow>
        <mrow>\Omega(\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_n) \amp = \det\bbm \vv_1\amp\cdots\amp \vv_n\ebm</mrow>
      </md>
      is an <m>n</m>-linear form.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <p>
    For bilinear forms, the example <m>\phi_A</m> given above can be  viewed as prototypical.
  </p>

  <exercise workspace="3.5in" label="ex-forms-1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let <m>B=\basis{e}{n}</m>
        be an ordered basis for <m>V</m>.
        Let <m>\phi:V\times V\to \R</m> be a bilinear form on <m>V</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Show that there exists an <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A_\phi</m> such that
        <me>
          \phi(\vv,\ww) = (C_B(\vv))^TA_\phi C_B(\ww),
        </me>
        where <m>C_B</m> denotes the coordinate isomorphism from <m>V</m> to <m>\R^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    The above exercise tells us that we can study bilinear forms on a vector space by studying their matrix representations.
    This depends on a choice of basis, but, as one might expect, matrix representations with respect to different bases are similar.
  </p>

  <exercise workspace="2.5in" label="ex-forms-2">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>B_1,B_2</m> be two ordered bases for a finite-dimensional vector space <m>V</m>,
        and let <m>P=P_{B_1\leftarrow B_2}</m> be the change of basis matrix for these bases.
        Let <m>\phi:V\times V\to \R</m> be a linear functional on <m>V</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If <m>A_\phi</m> is the matrix of <m>\phi</m> with respect to the basis <m>B_1</m>,
        show that the matrix of <m>\phi</m> with respect to <m>B_2</m> is equal to <m>P^TA_\phi P</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    Bilinear forms also transform with respect to linear transformations in a manner similar to linear functionals.
  </p>

  <exercise workspace="2.25in" label="ex-forms-3">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>V</m> and <m>W</m> be finite-dimensional vector spaces,
        and let <m>T:V\to W</m> be a linear transformation.
      </p>

      <p>
        If <m>\phi:W\times W\to\R</m> is a bilinar form on <m>W</m>,
        show that the map <m>T^*\phi:V\times V\to \R</m> defined by
        <me>
          T^*\phi(\vv,\ww) = \phi(T(\vv),T(\ww))
        </me>
        is a bilinear form on <m>V</m>, called the <term>pullback</term> of <m>\phi</m> by <m>T</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    A bilinear form <m>\phi</m> on <m>V</m> is <term>symmetric</term> if <m>\phi(\vv,\ww)=\phi(\ww,\vv)</m> for all <m>\vv,\ww\in V</m>,
    and <term>antisymmetric</term> (or <term>alternating</term>) if <m>\phi(\vv,\ww)=-\phi(\ww,\vv)</m> for all <m>\vv,\ww</m> in <m>V</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A bilinear form is <term>nondegenerate</term> if, for each nonzero vector <m>\vv\in V</m>, there exists a vector <m>\ww\in V</m> such that <m>\phi(\vv,\ww)\neq 0</m>.
    (Alternatively, for each nonzero <m>\vv\in V</m>, the linear functional <m>\alpha(\ww)=\phi(\vv,\ww)</m> is nonzero.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Two types of bilinear forms are of particular importance: a symmetric, nondegenerate bilinear form on <m>V</m> is called an <term>inner product</term> on <m>V</m>,
    if it is also <term>positive-definite</term>: for each <m>\vv\in V</m>, <m>\phi(\vv,\vv)\geq 0</m>, with equality only if <m>\vv=\mathbf{0}</m>.
    Inner products are a generalization of the dot product from <xref ref="ch-orthogonality"/>.
    A future version of this book may take the time to study inner products in more detail, but for now we will look at another type of bilinear form.
  </p>

  <p>
    A nondegenerate, antisymmetric bilinear form <m>\omega</m> on <m>V</m> is called a <term>linear symplectic structure</term> on <m>V</m>,
    and we call the pair <m>(V,\omega)</m> a <term>symplectic vector space</term>.
    Symplectic structures are important in differential geometry and mathematical physics. (They can be used to encode <em>Hamilton's equations</em> in classical mechanics.)
  </p>

  <p>
    An example of a symplectic form on <m>\R^2</m> is given as follows: for vectors <m>\vv = (v_1,v_2)</m> and <m>\ww = (\ww_1,\ww_2)</m>,
    <me>
      \omega(\vv,\ww) = v_1w_2-v_2w_1
    </me>.
    If this looks familiar, it's because this is precisely the determinant of the <m>2\times 2</m> matrix <m>\bbm \vv\amp \ww\ebm</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A more general example is given by <m>V=\R^{2n}</m>. If we write <m>\vv = \langle a_1,b_1,\ldots, a_n,b_n\rangle</m>, <m>\ww = \langle c_1,d_1,\ldots, c_n,d_n\rangle</m>,
    then the <term>standard symplectic structure</term> on <m>\R^{2n}</m> is given by
    <me>
      \omega(\vv,\ww) = a_1d_1-b_1c_1 + \cdots + a_nd_n-b_nc_n
    </me>.
    Note how this resembles a sum of <m>2\times 2</m> determinants.
  </p>

  <remark xml:id="rem-std-symplectic">
    <p>
      A theorem that you will not be asked to prove (it's a long proof...) is that if a vector space <m>V</m> has a linear symplectic structure <m>\omega</m>,
      then the dimension of <m>V</m> is even, and <m>V</m> has a basis <m>\{\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{f}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{e}_n,\mathbf{f}_n\}</m>
      with respect to which the matrix representation of <m>\omega</m> is equivalent to the standard symplectic structure on <m>\R^{2n}</m>.
    </p>
  </remark>

    
  <p>
    We conclude with some interesting connections between complex vector spaces and symplectic and inner product structures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is an observation you may have made before: to any complex number <m>a+ib</m> we can associate the matrix
    <me>
      \bbm a\amp -b\\b\amp a\ebm = a\bbm 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\ebm + b\bbm 0\amp -1\\1\amp 0\ebm = aI+bJ
    </me>,
    where <m>I</m> is the <m>2\times 2</m> identity matrix, and <m>J^2=-I</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can even check that multiplying two complex numbers is the same as multiplying the corresponding matrices, as given above!
  </p>

  <exercise workspace="5in" label="ex-forms-4">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For the symplectic structure <m>\omega(\vv,\ww) = v_1w_2-v_2w_1</m> on <m>\R^2</m>,
        as given above, show that the matrix of <m>\omega</m> with respect to the standard basis is the matrix
        <m>J_1 = \bbm 0\amp -1\\ 1\amp 0\ebm</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, for any symplectic vector space <m>(V,\omega)</m>, show that,
        with respect to the basis <m>\{\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{f}_1,\ldots, \mathbf{e}_n,\mathbf{f}_n\}</m>
        described in <xref ref="rem-std-symplectic"/> above, the matrix of <m>\omega</m> has the block form
        <me>
          J = \bbm J_1 \amp 0 \amp \cdots \amp 0\\ 0\amp J_1\amp \cdots \amp 0\\ \vdots\amp \vdots \amp \ddots\amp \cdots\\0\amp 0\amp \cdots \amp J_1\ebm
        </me>.
        
      </p>
    </statement>
    
  </exercise>

  <p>
    There are also interesting relationships between complex inner products, real inner products, and symplectic structures.
  </p>

  <exercise workspace="7in" label="ex-forms-5">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\langle \vv,\ww\rangle</m> denote the standard complex inner product on <m>\C^n</m>.
        (Recall that such an inner product is complex linear in the second argument,
        but for any complex scalar <m>c</m>, <m>\langle c\vv,\ww\rangle = \overline{c}\langle \vv,\ww\rangle</m>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Write <m>\vv = \mathbf{a}+i\mathbf{b}</m> and <m>\ww = \mathbf{c}+i\mathbf{d}</m>,
        where <m>\mathbf{a} = \langle a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\rangle\in\R^n</m> (with similar statements for <m>\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d}</m>).
        Let <m>\xx = \langle a_1,b_1,\ldots, a_n,b_n\rangle, \yy = \langle c_1,d_1,\ldots, c_n,d_n\rangle\in \R^{2n}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Show that
        <me>
          \langle \vv,\ww\rangle = \xx\cdot \yy + i\phi(\xx,\yy)
        </me>,
        where <m>\phi</m> denotes the standard symplectic structure on <m>\R^{2n}</m>.
