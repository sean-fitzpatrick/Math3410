  <p>
    Note that a zero vector must exist in every vector space.
    This simple observation is a key component of many proofs and counterexamples in linear algebra.
    In general, we may define a vector space whose scalars belong to a <em>field</em> <m>\mathbb{F}</m>.
    A field is a set of objects whose algebraic properties are modelled after those of the real numbers.
    Fields have their <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)#Classic_definition" visual="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)#Classic_definition">own set of axioms</url>,
    which we will not list here.
    While it is possible to study linear algebra over <em>finite fields</em> (like the integers modulo a prime number)
    we will only consider two fields: the real numbers <m>\R</m>, and the complex numbers <m>\C</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A vector space whose scalars are complex numbers will be called a <em>complex vector space</em>.
    While many students are initially intimidated by the complex numbers,
    most results in linear algebra work exactly the same over <m>\C</m> as they do over <m>\R</m>.
    And where the results differ, things are usually <em>easier</em> with complex numbers,
    owing in part to the fact that all complex polynomials can be completely factored.
  </p>

  <p>
    To help us gain familiarity with the abstract nature of <xref ref="def-vector-space"/>,
    let us consider some basic examples.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex-vector-spaces">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The following are examples of vector spaces. We leave verification of axioms as an exercise.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The set <m>\R^n</m> of <m>n</m>-tuples <m>(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)</m> of real numbers,
              where we define
              <md>
                <mrow>(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)+(y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_n) \amp = (x_1+y_1,x_2+y_2,\ldots, x_n+y_n) </mrow>
                <mrow> c(x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n)\amp = (cx_1,cx_2,\ldots, cx_n)</mrow>
              </md>.
              We will also often use <m>\R^n</m> to refer to the vector space of <m>1\times n</m> column matrices <m>\bbm x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\ebm</m>,
              where addition and scalar multiplication are defined as for matrices
              (and the same as the above, with the only difference being the way in which we choose to write our vectors).
              If the distinction between <m>n</m>-tuples and column matrices is ever important, it will be made clear.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The set <m>\mathbf{M}_{mn}</m> of <m>m\times n</m> matrices, equipped with the usual matrix addition and scalar multiplication.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The set <m>\mathbf{P}_n</m> of all polynomials
              <me>
                p(x) = a_0+a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n
              </me>
              of degree less than or equal to <m>n</m>, where, for
              <md>
                <mrow>p(x) \amp = a_0+a_1x+\cdots + a_nx^n </mrow>
                <mrow>q(x) \amp = b_0+b_1x+\cdots +b_nx^n</mrow>
              </md>
              we define
              <me>
                p(x)+q(x)=(a_0+b_0)+(a_1+b_1)x+\cdots + (a_n+b_n)x^n
              </me>
              and
              <me>
                cp(x) = ca_0+(ca_1)x+\cdots + (ca_n)x^n
              </me>.
              The zero vector is the polynomial <m>0=0+0x+\cdots + 0x^n</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The set <m>\mathbf{F}[a,b]</m> of all functions <m>f:[a,b]\to \R</m>,
              where we define <m>(f+g)(x)=f(x)+g(x)</m> and <m>(cf)(x)=c(f(x))</m>.
              The zero function is the function satisfying <m>0(x)=0</m> for all <m>x\in [a,b]</m>,
              and the negative of a function <m>f</m> is given by <m>(-f)(x)=-f(x)</m> for all <m>x\in [a,b]</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    Other common examples of vector spaces can be found online;
    for example, <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_vector_spaces" visual="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_vector_spaces">on Wikipedia</url>.
    It is also interesting to try to think of less common examples.
    For example, can you think of a way to define a vector space structure on the set
    <m>(0,\infty)</m> of all positive real numbers?
  </p>

  <p>
    There are a number of other algebraic properties that are common to all vector spaces;
    for example, it is true that <m>0\vv = \zer</m> for all vectors <m>\vv</m> in any vector space <m>V</m>.
    The reason these are not included is that the ten axioms in <xref ref="def-vector-space"/>
    are the ones deemed <q>essential</q> <ndash /> all other properties can be deduced from the axioms.
    To demonstrate, we next give the proof that <m>0\vv = \zer</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm-zero-mult">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In any vector space <m>V</m>, we have <m>0\vv = \zer</m> for all <m>\vv\in V</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>0+0=0</m>, we have <m>0\vv=(0+0)\vv</m>.
        Using the distributive axiom S3, this becomes
        <me>
          0\vv + 0\vv = 0\vv
        </me>.
         By axiom A5, there is an element <m>-0\vv\in V</m> such that <m>0\vv+(-0\vv)=\zer</m>.
         Adding this to both sides of the equation above, we get:
         <me>
           (0\vv+0\vv)+(-0\vv) = 0\vv+(-0\vv)
         </me>.
         Now, apply the associative property (A3) on the left, and A5 on the right, to get
         <me>
           0\vv + (0\vv+(-0\vv)) = \zer
         </me>.
         Using A5 again on the left, we get <m>0\vv+\zer = \zer</m>.
         Finally, axiom A4 guarantees <m>0\vv = 0\vv+\zer = \zer</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

  </theorem>

    Similar tactics can be used to establish the following results,
    which we leave as an exercise.
    Solutions are included, but it will be worth your while in the long run to wrestle with these.

              The main difficulty with this problem is getting the logic of the statement correct,
              and making sure you know what it is you're trying to prove.
              The desired conclusion is an <em>or</em> statement, which means it suffices to establish one part or the other.
              Typically, the way to proceed in these cases is to argue that if the first part is false,
              then the second must be true. This is how we proceed here.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose that <m>c\vv=\zer</m>. If <m>c=0</m>,
              then it's true that <m>c=0</m> or <m>\vv=\zer</m>,
              so there's nothing to prove.
              Suppose then that <m>c\neq 0</m>. Then there exists a real number <m>\frac1c</m> such that <m>c\bigl(\frac1c\bigr)=1</m>.
              Multiplying both sides of <m>c\vv=\zer</m> by <m>\frac1c</m>, we get
              <me>
                \frac1c(c\vv)=\frac1c\zer
              </me>.
              By the previous problem, we know that <m>\frac1c\zer = \zer</m>,
              and by axioms S4 and S5, we have
              <me>
                \frac1c(c\vv)=\bigl(\frac1c\cdot c\bigr)\vv = 1\vv = \vv
              </me>,
              showing that <m>\vv=\zer</m>, and thus <m>c=0</m> or <m>\vv=\zer</m>.
              (This is a proof by cases, relying on the tautology <m>c=0</m> or <m>c\neq 0</m>.)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose there are two vectors <m>\zer_1,\zer_2</m> that act as additive identities.
              Then
              <md>
                <mrow>\zer_1 \amp = \zer_1+\zer_2 \quad \text{ since } \vv+\zer_2=\vv \text{ for any } \vv</mrow>
                <mrow>  \amp =\zer_2+\zer_1 \quad \text{ by axiom A2}</mrow>

              </md>
              So any two vectors satisfying the property in A4 must, in fact, be the same.
