  <title>Project: linear dynamical systems</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Suppose we have a sequence <m>(x_n)</m> defined by a linear recurrence of length <m>k</m>,
      as in <xref ref="project-recurrence"/>:
      <me>
        x_{n+k} = a_0x_k + a_1x_{k+1}+\cdots + a_{k-1}x_{n-k+1}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would like to represent this as a matrix equation,
      and then use eigenvalues to analyze,
      replacing the recurrence formula with a matrix equation of the form <m>\vv_{k+1}=A\vv_k</m>.
      A sequence of vectors generated in this way is called a <term>linear dynamical system</term>.
      It is a good model for systems with discrete time evolution (where changes occur in steps, rather than continuously).
    </p>

    <p>
      To determine the long term evolution of the system, we would like to be able to compute
      <me>
        \vv_n  = A^n \vv_0
      </me>
      without first finding all the intermediate states,
      so this is a situation where we would like to be able to efficiently compute powers of a matrix.
      Fortunately, we know how to do this when <m>A</m> is diagonalizable:
      <m>A^n = PD^nP^{-1}</m>, where <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>,
      and <m>P</m> is the matrix of corresponding eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.

  <exercise label="ex-dynamical-predator">
    <title>Challenge/Project Problem: Predator-Prey Systems</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        As a more practical example, consider the following (over-simplified) predator-prey system.
        It is based on an example in <url href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/dds.html" visual="personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/dds.html">Interactive Linear Algebra</url>,
        by Margalit, Rabinoff, and Williams, but adapted to the wildlife here in Lethbridge.
        An ecosystem contains both coyotes and deer.
        Initially, there is a population of <m>20</m> coyotes, and <m>500</m> deer.
      </p>

      <p>
        We assume the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              the share of the deer population eaten by a typical coyote in a year is <m>10</m> deer
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              in the absence of the coyotes, the deer population would increase by <m>50</m>% per year
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>20</m>% of the coyote population dies each year of natural causes
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the growth rate of the coyote population depends on the number of deer:
              for each 100 deer, <m>10</m> coyote pups will survive to adulthood.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        If we let <m>d_t</m> denote the number of deer after <m>t</m> years,
        and <m>c_t</m> the number of coyotes, then we have
        <md>
          <mrow>d_{t+1} \amp = 1.5d_t - 10c_t</mrow>
          <mrow>c_{t+1} \amp = 0.1d_t + 0.8c_t</mrow>
        </md>,
        or, in matrix form,
        <me>
          \mathbf{p}_{t+1} = A\mathbf{p}_t
        </me>,
        where <m>\mathbf{p}_t=\bbm d_t\\c_t\ebm</m> and <m>A = \bbm 1.5 \amp -10\\0.1 \amp 0.8\ebm</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        After <m>t</m> years, the two populations will be given by <m>\mathbf{p}_t=A^t\mathbf{p}_0</m>,
        where <m>\mathbf{p}_0=\bbm 500\\20\ebm</m> gives the initial populations of the two species.
        If possible, we would like to be able to find a closed-form formula for <m>\mathbf{p}_t</m>,
        which would allow us to analyze the long-term predictions of our model.

    <title>Challenge/Project Problem: Markov Chains</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        A special type of linear dynamical system occurs when the matrix <m>A</m>
        is <term>stochastic</term>.
        A stochastic matrix is one where each entry of the matrix is between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>,
        and all of the columns of the matrix sum to <m>1</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason for these conditions is that the entries of a stochastic matrix represent probabilities;
        in particular, they are <term>transition probabilities</term>.
        That is, each number represents the probability of one state changing to another.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a system can be in one of <m>n</m> possible states,
        we represent the system by an <m>n\times 1</m> vector <m>\vv_t</m>,
        whose entries indicate the probability that the system is in a given state at time <m>t</m>.
        If we know that the system starts out in a particular state,
        then <m>\vv_0</m> will have a <m>1</m> in one of its entries, and <m>0</m> everywhere else.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Markov chain is given by such an initial vector, and a stochastic matrix.
        As an example, we will consider the following scenario,
        described in the book <em>Shape</em>, by Jordan Ellenberg:
      </p>

      <p>
        A mosquito is born in a swamp, which we will call Swamp A.
        There is another nearby swamp, called Swamp B.
        Observational data suggests that when a mosquito is at Swamp A,
        there is a 40% chance that it will remain there,
        and a 60% chance that it will move to Swamp B.
        When the mosquito is at Swamp B, there is a 70% chance that it will remain,
        and a 30% chance that it will return to Swamp A.
