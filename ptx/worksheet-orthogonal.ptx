  <title>Worksheet: Orthogonal bases</title>
  
    <p>
      This worksheet will give you an opportunity to work with orthogonal sets of vectors in <m>\R^n</m>, 
      and explore some of the related results. First, we will look at the construction of an orthogonal complement.

            Extend the basis from part (a) to a basis of <m>\R^7</m>.

          <p>
            <em>Suggestion</em>: recall that you can extend to a basis by adding elements of the standard basis for <m>\R^7</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Use the code cell below to enter a matrix you can use to confirm that your basis is, in fact, a basis.

          <p>
            Once your testing indicates that you have successfully found a basis, input your basis vectors below.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Suggestion</em>: in part (a), you probably used the command <c>A.nullspace()</c>
            to find the basis for <m>\ker(T)</m>. If you enter this as
            <cd>
              <cline>B1 = A.nullspace()</cline>
              <cline>B1</cline>
            </cd>
            then you can use the name <c>B1</c> to recall those vectors, so you don't have to input them manually.
            The object <c>B1</c> is a list of vectors, and you can call elements of that list as
            <c>B1[0]</c>, <c>B1[1]</c>, <etc/>.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, input the vectors that you added to <c>B1</c> to get a basis of <m>\R^7</m>.
            (For example, you might enter <c>e1 = Matrix([1,0,0,0,0,0,0])</c>.)
            Then define your basis as a list <c>B</c>.
            For example, you might enter <c>B = (B1[0],B1[1],B1[2],e1,e2,e3,e4)</c>,
            if you found that there were three vectors in the list <c>B1</c>,
            and that the first 4 standard basis vectors were sufficient to get you a basis for <m>\R^7</m>.
            (This may not be what you find, of course.)

            Let <m>U = \ker(T)</m>. If <m>\dim U = k</m>, then the first <m>k</m> vectors of your orthogonal basis from
            <m>\R^7</m> form an orthogonal basis for <m>U</m>, according to the Gram-Schmidt theorem.
            Confirm that each of the remaining vectors in this basis are orthogonal to the vectors in the basis <c>B1</c>.

            It follows that the remaining vectors are elements of <m>U^\bot</m>.
            In fact, they form a basis. we know they are independent, because they are part of a basis for <m>\R^7</m>.
            And since <m>\dim U+\dim U^\bot = \dim \R^7</m>, we know we have the right number.
