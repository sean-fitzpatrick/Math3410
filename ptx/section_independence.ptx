  <title>Linear Independence</title>

  <p>
    In any vector space <m>V</m>, we say that a set of vectors
    <me>
      \{\vv_1,\ldots,\vv_k\}
    </me>
    is <term>linearly independent</term> if for any scalars <m>c_1,\ldots, c_k</m>
    <me>
      c_1\vv_1+\cdots + c_k\vv_k = \mathbf{0} \quad\Rightarrow\quad c_1=\cdots = c_k=0
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means that no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in that set.
    We will soon see that when looking for vectors that span a subspace,
    it is especially useful to find a spanning set that is also linearly independent.
    The following lemma establishes some basic properties of independent sets.
  </p>

  <lemma>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In any vector space <m>V</m>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>\vv\neq\mathbf{0}</m>, then <m>\{\vv\}</m> is independent.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>S\subseteq V</m> contains the zero vector, then <m>S</m> is dependent.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>

  <p>
    The definition of linear independence tells us that if <m>\{\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_k\}</m>
    is an independent set of vectors, then there is only one way to write <m>\mathbf{0}</m>
    as a linear combination of these vectors; namely,
    <me>
      \mathbf{0} = 0\vv_1+0\vv_2+\cdots +0\vv_k
    </me>.
    In fact, more is true: <em>any</em> vector in the span of a linearly independent set
    can be written in only one way as a linear combination of those vectors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Computationally, questions about linear independence are just questions
    about homogeneous systems of linear equations.
    For example, suppose we want to know if the vectors
    <me>
      \uu=\bbm 1\\-1\\4\ebm, \vv=\bbm 0\\2\\-3\ebm, \ww=\bbm 4\\0\\-3\ebm
    </me>
    are linearly independent in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
    This question leads to the vector equation
    <me>
      x\uu+y\vv+z\ww=\mathbf{0}
    </me>,
    which becomes the matrix equation
    <me>
      \bbm 1\amp0\amp4\\-1\amp2\amp0\\4\amp-3\amp-3\ebm\bbm x\\y\\z\ebm = \bbm 0\\0\\0\ebm
    </me>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We now apply some basic theory from linear algebra.
    A unique (and therefore, trivial) solution to this system is guaranteed if the matrix
    <m>A = \bbm 1\amp0\amp4\\-1\amp2\amp0\\4\amp-3\amp-3\ebm</m> is invertible,
    since in that case we have <m>\bbm x\\y\\z\ebm = A^{-1}\mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach is problematic, however, since it won't work if we have 2 vectors, or 4.
    Instead, we look at the reduced row-echelon form.
    A unique solution corresponds to having a leading 1 in each column of <m>A</m>.
    Let's check this condition.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      from sympy import Matrix,init_printing
      init_printing()
      A = Matrix(3,3,[1,0,4,-1,2,0,4,-3,-3])
      A.rref()
    </input>
    <output>
      \[\bbm 1\amp 0\amp 0\\0\amp 1\amp 0\\0\amp 0\amp 1\ebm, (0,1,2)\]
    </output>
  </sage>

  <p>
    One observation is useful here, and will lead to a better understanding of independence.
    First, it would be impossible to have 4 or more linearly independent vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.
    Why? (How many leading ones can you have in a <m>3\times 4</m> matrix?)
    Second, having two or fewer vectors makes it more likely that the set is independent.
  </p>

  <p>
    The largest set of linearly independent vectors possible in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> contains three vectors.
    You might have also observed that the smallest number of vectors needed to span <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> is 3.
    Hmm. Seems like there's something interesting going on here. But first, some more computation.
  </p>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine whether the set <m>\left\{\bbm 1\\2\\0\ebm, \bbm -1\\0\\3\ebm,\bbm -1\\4\\9\ebm\right\}</m>
        is linearly independent in <m>\R^3</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Again, we set up a matrix and reduce:
      </p>

      <sage>
        <input>
          from sympy import Matrix,init_printing
          init_printing()
          A = Matrix(3,3,[1,-1,-1,2,0,4,0,3,9])
          A.rref()
        </input>
        <output>
          \[\bbm 1\amp 0\amp 2\\0\amp 1\amp 3\\0\amp 0\amp 0\ebm, (0,1)\]
        </output>
      </sage>

      <p>
        Notice that this time we don't get a unique solution, so we can conclude that these vectors are <em>not</em> independent.
        Furthermore, you can probably deduce from the above that we have <m>2\vv_1+3\vv_2-\vv_3=\mathbf{0}</m>.
        Now suppose that <m>\ww\in\spn\{\vv_1,\vv_2,\vv_3\}</m>.
        In how many ways can we write <m>\ww</m> as a linear combination of these vectors?
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>



  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Which of the following subsets of <m>P_2(\mathbb{R})</m> are independent?
        <md>
          <mrow>\text{(a) } S_1 = \{x^2+1, x+1, x\}</mrow>
          <mrow>\text{(b) } S_2 = \{x^2-x+3, 2x^2+x+5, x^2+5x+1\}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        In each case, we set up the defining equation for independence, collect terms,
        and then analyze the resulting system of equations.
        (If you work with polynomials often enough,
        you can probably jump straight to the matrix.
        For now, let's work out the details.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose
        <me>
          r(x^2+1)+s(x+1)+tx = 0
        </me>.
        Then <m>rx^2+(s+t)x+(r+s)=0=0x^2+0x+0</m>, so
        <md>
          <mrow>r \amp =0</mrow>
          <mrow>s+t \amp =0</mrow>
          <mrow>r+s\amp =0</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And in this case, we don't even need to ask the computer.
        The first equation gives <m>r=0</m> right away,
        and putting that into the third equation gives <m>s=0</m>,
        and the second equation then gives <m>t=0</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since <m>r=s=t=0</m> is the only solution, the set is independent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Repeating for <m>S_2</m> leads to the equation
        <me>
          (r+2s+t)x^2+(-r+s+5t)x+(3r+5s+t)1=0.
        </me>
        This gives us:
      </p>

      <sage>
        <input>
          from sympy import Matrix,init_printing
          init_printing()
          A = Matrix(3,3,[1,2,1,-1,1,5,3,5,1])
          A.rref()
        </input>
        <output>
          \[\bbm 1\amp 0\amp -3\\0\amp 1\amp 2\\0\amp 0\amp 0\ebm, (0,1)\]
        </output>
      </sage>
    </solution>
  </exercise>



  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine whether or not the set
        <me>
          \left\{\bbm -1\amp 0\\0\amp -1\ebm, \bbm 1\amp -1\\ -1\amp 1\ebm,
                 \bbm 1\amp 1\\1\amp 1\ebm, \bbm 0\amp -1\\-1\amp 0\ebm\right\}
        </me>
        is linearly independent in <m>M_2(\mathbb{R})</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Again, we set a linear combination equal to the zero vector, and combine:
        <md>
          <mrow>a\bbm -1\amp 0\\0\amp -1\ebm +b\bbm 1\amp -1\\ -1\amp 1\ebm
            +c\bbm 1\amp 1\\1\amp 1\ebm +d \bbm 0\amp -1\\-1\amp 0\ebm = \bbm 0\amp 0\\ 0\amp 0\ebm</mrow>
          <mrow>\bbm -a+b+c\amp -b+c-d\\-b+c-d\amp -a+b+c\ebm = \bbm 0\amp 0\\0\amp 0\ebm</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could proceed, but we might instead notice right away that equations 1 and 4 are identical,
        and so are equations 2 and 3.
        With only two distinct equations and 4 unknowns, we're certain to find nontrivial solutions.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>
