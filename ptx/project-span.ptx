  <title>Project: working with span</title>
  <p>
    In this worksheet, we will attempt to understand the concept of span.
    Recall from <xref ref="sec-span"/> that the span of a set of vectors
    <m>\vv_1, \vv_2,\ldots, \vv_k</m> in a vector space <m>V</m>
    is the set of all linear combinations that can be generated from those vectors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall the following fact: given a matrix <m>A</m> and vector <m>\xx</m>,
    <m>A\xx</m> is a linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In particular, if we write <m>A</m> in terms of its columns as <m>A = \bbm \vv_1 \amp \vv_2 \amp  \cdots \amp \vv_n\ebm</m>
    then
    <me>
      A\xx = x_1\vv_1+x_2\vv_2+\cdots + x_n\vv_n
    </me>,
    where <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_n</m> are the components of <m>\xx</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's confirm this for the matrix <m>A = \bbm 2\amp 3\amp -5\amp 6\\-7\amp 20\amp -11\amp 6\\43 \amp -6\amp 31\amp 2\ebm</m>
    and vector <m>\xx = \bbm 7\\-9\\3\\14\ebm</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Input the matrix and vector in the cell below.
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      import sympy as sy
      sy.init_printing()
    </input>
  </sage>

  <p>
    See <xref ref="sec-sympy"/> for details on how to enter your matrix and vector,
    and how to compute the following.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, compute <m>A\xx</m>:
  </p>

  <sage>
    <input>
      
    </input>
    
  </sage>
  
  <p>
    Finally, compute the corresponding linear combination of the columns of <m>A</m>,
    and confirm that you get the same answer.
  </p>

    The question <q>Does the vector <m>\ww</m> belong to the span of <m>\vv_1, \vv_2,\ldots, \vv_k</m>?</q>
    is equivalent to asking, <q>Can I write <m>\ww</m> as a linear combination of the <m>\vv_i</m>?</q>
    This, in turn, is equivalent to asking:
  </p>

  <p>
    Do there exist scalars <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_k</m> such that
    <me>
      \ww=x_1\vv_1+x_2\vv_2+\cdots +x_k\vv_k
    </me>?
  </p>

  <p>
    If the above vectors are vectors in <m>\R^n</m>,
    then we just saw that the right-hand side of the above equation is <m>A\xx</m>,
    where <m>\vv_1,\vv_2,\ldots, \vv_k</m> are the columns of <m>A</m>.
    So the question of whether <m>\ww</m> is in the span of the <m>\vv_i</m>
    is equivalent to determining whether the equation <m>A\xx=\ww</m> has a solution.
  </p>

  <exercise label="ex-ws-span-1">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine whether or not the vector <m>\ww=\langle 3,-1, 4, 2\rangle</m> in <m>\R^4</m>
        belongs to the span of the vectors
        <me>
          \langle 2, 1, 4, -3\rangle, \langle 0, 2, 1, 4\rangle, \langle -1, 1, 0, 2\rangle
        </me>.

    To assist with solving this problem, a code cell is provided below.
    Once you have determined the augmented matrix of your system of equations,
    enter the matrix,
    and then compute its reduced row-echelon form.

    (Do you recall how to tell if a system has a solution from the <init>RREF</init>?)

  <p>
    If our vector space is not <m>\R^n</m>, we can still apply the above technique,
    but we first have to turn our span equation into a system of linear equations.

    The above problems all answer the same basic question: given a <em>particular</em> vector <m>\ww</m>, 
    is it in the span of given vectors <m>\vv_1,\vv_2,\ldots,\vv_k</m>?
  </p>

  <p>
    A more interesting problem is the following: 
    iven the vectors <m>\vv_1,\vv_2,\ldots, \vv_k</m>, what are <em>all</em> the vectors in their span? 
    That is, how can we describe the span of a set of vectors more directly?
  </p>

  <p>
    We can answer this question as follows: let <m>\ww</m> be an <em>arbitrary</em> vector in <m>V</m>, 
    and write it in terms of its (unknown) coefficients. For example, in question 1 above, 
    we might let <m>\ww = \langle a, b, c, d\rangle</m>.
  </p>

  <exercise label="ex-ws-span-4">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For each problem above, define symbolic variables using the <c>symobols</c> command.
        For example, you can enter
        <cd>
          <cline>a, b, c = symbols('a b c')</cline>
        </cd>
        to create three undetermined symbols.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then replace the last column in each augmeted matrix from the previous problems with a column of symbols,
        and instead of using the <c>rref()</c> command, use the <c>echelon_form()</c> command to reduce the matrix.
      </p>

      <p>
        By looking at the reduced form of the matrix, determine a relationship (or relationships)
        between the variables that must hold for the system to be consistent.
        You can then use this to define the set of vectors in the span.
