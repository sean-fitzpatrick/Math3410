<p>The term “complement” comes from terminology we mentioned early on, but didn't spend much time on. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-construct-complement.html" title="Theorem 1.8.10">Theorem 1.8.10</a> told us that for any subspace <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> of a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> it is possible to construct another subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(V = U\oplus W\text{.}\)</span> The subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is known as a complement of <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> A complement is not unique, but the orthogonal complement is. As you might guess from the name, <span class="process-math">\(U^\bot\)</span> is also a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{.}\)</span></p>
