<div class="para">Given a set of vectors <span class="process-math">\(S=\{\vv_1,\vv_2,\ldots, \vv_k\}\text{,}\)</span> an important question is therefore: can any of these vectors be written as a linear combination of other vectors in the set? If the answer is no, we say that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">linearly independent</dfn>. This is a difficult condition to check, however: first, we would have to show that <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1\)</span> cannot be written as a linear combination of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2,\ldots, \vv_k\text{.}\)</span> Then, that <span class="process-math">\(\vv_2\)</span> cannot be written in terms of <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1,\vv_3,\ldots, \vv_k\text{,}\)</span> and so on.</div>
