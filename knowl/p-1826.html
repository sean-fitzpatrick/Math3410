<div class="para">A mosquito is born in a swamp, which we will call Swamp A. There is another nearby swamp, called Swamp B. Observational data suggests that when a mosquito is at Swamp A, there is a 40% chance that it will remain there, and a 60% chance that it will move to Swamp B. When the mosquito is at Swamp B, there is a 70% chance that it will remain, and a 30% chance that it will return to Swamp A.</div>
