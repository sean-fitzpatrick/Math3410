<div class="para">Recall that in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-subspace-lines-and-planes.html" title="Example 1.3.4">Example 1.3.4</a>, we had to take care to insist that the vectors spanning our plane were not parallel. Otherwise, what we thought was a plane would, in fact, be only a line. Similarly, we said that a line is given by the set of all vectors of the form <span class="process-math">\(t\vv\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is a scalar, and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> <em class="emphasis">is not the zero vector</em>. Otherwise, if <span class="process-math">\(\vv=\zer\text{,}\)</span> we would have <span class="process-math">\(t\vv=\zer\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(t\in\R\text{,}\)</span> and our “line” would be the trivial subspace.</div>
