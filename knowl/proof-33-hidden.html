<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Both parts of the proof rely on the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-subspace-test.html" title="Theorem 1.3.2: Subspace Test">Subspace Test</a>. So for each set, we first need to explain why it contains the zero vector. Next comes closure under addition: assume you have to elements of the set, then use the definition to explain what that means.</p>
<p>Now you have to show that the sum of those elements belongs to the set as well. It's fairly safe to assume that this is going to involve the addition property of a linear transformation!</p>
<p>Scalar multiplication is handled similarly, but using the scalar multiplication property of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span></p></article></body>
