<div class="para">The above definition leads to the following result, also known as the Principal Axes Theorem. A careful proof is quite difficult, and omitted from this book. The hard part is showing that any symmetric matrix is orthogonally diagonalizable. There are a few ways to do this, most requiring induction on the size of the matrix. A common approach actually uses multivariable calculus! (Optimization via Lagrange multipliers, to be precise.) If you are reading this along with the book by Nicholson, there is a gap in his proof: in the induction step, he assumes the existence of a real eigenalue of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> but this has to be proved!</div>
