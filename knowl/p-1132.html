<p>This isn't hard to do by hand, but it's useful to know how to ask the computer to do it, too. Unfortunately, the dot product in SymPy does not include the complex conjugate. One likely reason for this is that while most mathematicians take the complex conjugate of the <em class="emphasis">second</em> vector, some mathematicians, and most physicists, put the conjugate on the first vector. So they may have decided to remain agnostic about this choice. We can manually apply the conjugate, using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Z.dot(W.H)</code>.</p>
