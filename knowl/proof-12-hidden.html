<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"> <div class="para">We want to show that a set of vectors is linearly independent, so we should begin by setting a linear combination of these vectors equal to the zero vector. Our goal is to show that all the coefficients have to be zero.</div> <div class="para">Since the vector <span class="process-math">\(\uu\)</span> is “special”, its coefficient gets a different treatment, using a familiar tautology: either this coefficient is zero, or it isn’t.</div> <div class="para">what if the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(\uu\)</span> is nonzero? Does that contradict one of our assumptions? If the coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(\uu\)</span> is zero, then it disappears from our linear combination. What assumption applies to the remaining vectors?</div></article></body>
