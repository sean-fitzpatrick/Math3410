<div class="para">When we define a subspace as the span of a set of vectors, we want to have an idea of the size (or perhaps complexity) of the subspace. Certainly the number of vectors we use to generate the span gives a measure of this, but it is not the whole story: we also need to know how many of these vectors “depend” on other vectors in the generating set. As <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-surplus-span.html" title="Theorem 1.4.10">Theorem 1.4.10</a> tells us, when one of the vectors in our generating set can be written as a linear combination of the others, we can remove it as a generator without changing the span.</div>
