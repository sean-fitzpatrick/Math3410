<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">A special type of linear dynamical system occurs when the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">stochastic</dfn>. A stochastic matrix is one where each entry of the matrix is between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> and all of the columns of the matrix sum to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The reason for these conditions is that the entries of a stochastic matrix represent probabilities; in particular, they are <dfn class="terminology">transition probabilities</dfn>. That is, each number represents the probability of one state changing to another.</div> <div class="para">If a system can be in one of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> possible states, we represent the system by an <span class="process-math">\(n\times 1\)</span> vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv_t\text{,}\)</span> whose entries indicate the probability that the system is in a given state at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> If we know that the system starts out in a particular state, then <span class="process-math">\(\vv_0\)</span> will have a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> in one of its entries, and <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> everywhere else.</div> <div class="para">A Markov chain is given by such an initial vector, and a stochastic matrix. As an example, we will consider the following scenario, described in the book <em class="emphasis">Shape</em>, by Jordan Ellenberg:</div> <div class="para">A mosquito is born in a swamp, which we will call Swamp A. There is another nearby swamp, called Swamp B. Observational data suggests that when a mosquito is at Swamp A, there is a 40% chance that it will remain there, and a 60% chance that it will move to Swamp B. When the mosquito is at Swamp B, there is a 70% chance that it will remain, and a 30% chance that it will return to Swamp A.</div>
