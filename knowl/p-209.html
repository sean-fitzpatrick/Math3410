<div class="para">There are a few relatively easy things we can check before we begin:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<div class="para">Does the subset contain the zero vector?</div>
<div class="para">This is part of the subspace test, of course, but it tends to be easy to check, and if the answer is no, then weâ€™ve already ruled out the possibility that this subset could be a subspace.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">Is the equation defining the subset linear?</div>
<div class="para">If not, your subset is probably not a subspace, and you should look for a counterexample. For example, the set <span class="process-math">\(\{(x,y)\in\R^2 \,|\, y=x^2\}\)</span> contains zero, but it is defined by the nonlinear equation <span class="process-math">\(y=x^2\text{.}\)</span> This tells us that our set is unlikely to be a subspace, but we still have to demonstrate this. Typically, we do so by showing that one of the two closure axioms fails. For example, we know that <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((2,4)\)</span> belong to the subset, but <span class="process-math">\((1,1)+(2,4)=(3,5)\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(5\neq 3^2\text{,}\)</span> the subset is not closed under addition, and therefore is not a subspace.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">Is the equation defining the subset homogeneous?</div>
<div class="para">Even if an equation is linear, it may fail to define a subspace due to the special role played by the zero vector. For example, the plane in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> defined by the equation <span class="process-math">\(x+2y-5z=4\)</span> is not a subspace. The fastest way to see this is to note that the equation is not satisfied by the zero vector! But both closure conditions fail as well. For example, the point <span class="process-math">\((2,1,0)\)</span> is on the plane. But <span class="process-math">\(2(2,1,0)=(4,2,0)\)</span> is not, since <span class="process-math">\(4+2(2)-5(0)=8\neq 4\text{.}\)</span>
