<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">As a more practical example, consider the following (over-simplified) predator-prey system. It is based on an example in <a class="external" href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/dds.html" target="_blank">Interactive Linear Algebra</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-11-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, by Margalit, Rabinoff, and Williams, but adapted to the wildlife here in Lethbridge. An ecosystem contains both coyotes and deer. Initially, there is a population of <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> coyotes, and <span class="process-math">\(500\)</span> deer.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We assume the following:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">the share of the deer population eaten by a typical coyote in a year is <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> deer</div></li>
<li><div class="para">in the absence of the coyotes, the deer population would increase by <span class="process-math">\(50\)</span>% per year</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(20\)</span>% of the coyote population dies each year of natural causes</div></li>
<li><div class="para">the growth rate of the coyote population depends on the number of deer: for each 100 deer, <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> coyote pups will survive to adulthood.</div></li>
</ul>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">If we let <span class="process-math">\(d_t\)</span> denote the number of deer after <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> years, and <span class="process-math">\(c_t\)</span> the number of coyotes, then we have</div>

<div class="para">Analyze the eigenvalues of this matrix, and diagonalize. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">sympy</code> library won’t be up to the task.

<div class="para">You may have read this while wondering, “Does Sean actually know anything about ecology and population dynamics? Did he just make up those numbers?”</div> <div class="para">The answers are, respectively, no, and yes. Can you come up with numbers that are based on a realistic example? What does our model predict in that case?
