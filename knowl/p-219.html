<p>It's important to make sure you don't get lost in the notation here. Be sure that you can keep track of which symbols are vectors, and which are scalars! Note that in a sense, this is the most general sort of expression you can form using the two operations of a vector space, addition, and scalar multiplication. We multiply some collection of vectors by scalars, and then use addition to “combine” them into a single vector.</p>
