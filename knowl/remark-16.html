<div class="para">You might reasonably wonder: where does this definition come from? And why should I care? We are assuming that you saw at least a basic introduction to eigenvalues in your first course on linear algebra, but that course probably focused on mechanics. Possibly you learned that diagonalizing a matrix lets you compute powers of that matrix.</div> <div class="para">But why should we be interested in computing powers (in particular, <em class="emphasis">large</em> powers) of a matrix? An important context comes from the study of <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_dynamical_system" target="_blank">discrete linear dynamical systems</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-9-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, as well as <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" target="_blank">Markov chains</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-10-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>, where the evolution of a state is modelled by repeated multiplication of a vector by a matrix.</div> <div class="para">When we’re able to diagonalize our matrix using eigenvalues and eigenvectors, not only does it become easy to compute powers of a matrix, it also enables us to see that the entire process is just a linear combination of geometric sequences! If you have completed <a href="worksheet-recurrence.html" class="internal" title="Worksheet 2.5: Worksheet: linear recurrences">Worksheet 2.5</a>, you probably will not be surprised to learn that the polynomial roots you found are, in fact, eigenvalues of a suitable matrix. </div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-eigen-basics.html#remark-16" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
