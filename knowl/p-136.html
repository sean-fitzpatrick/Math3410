<p>This proof will be far more detailed than what you'll see in later sections. (We usually do not bother to take note of the axioms, one by one.) We will also try to explain our reasoning as we go, to help you get used to the sort of careful reasoning involved in a proof. Lines that should actually be included in the proof will be set aside in block quotes.</p>
