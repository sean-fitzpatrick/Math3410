<div class="para">The version of the <abbr class="initialism">SVD</abbr> given above is not used in computations, since it tends to be more resource intensive. In particular, it requires us to store more information than necessary: the last <span class="process-math">\(n-r\)</span> rows of <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> and the last <span class="process-math">\(m-r\)</span> columns of <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> get multiplied by columns/rows of zeros in <span class="process-math">\(\Sigma_A\text{,}\)</span> so we don’t really need to keep track of these columns.</div> <div class="para">Instead, most algorithms that you find will give the <span class="process-math">\(r\times r\)</span> diagonal matrix <span class="process-math">\(D_A\text{,}\)</span> consisting of the nonzero singular values, and <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> will be replaced by the <span class="process-math">\(m\times r\)</span> matrix consisting of its first <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> columns, while <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> gets replaced by the <span class="process-math">\(r\times n\)</span> matrix consisting of its first <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> rows. The resulting product is still equal to the original matrix.</div> <div class="para">In some cases, even the matrix <span class="process-math">\(D_A\)</span> is too large, and a decision is made to truncate to some smaller subset of singular values. In this case, the resulting product is no longer equal to the original matrix, but it does provide an approximation.
