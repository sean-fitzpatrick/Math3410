<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> was arbitrary, this shows that <span class="process-math">\(U_2 = \spn\{x^2-x,x-1\}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The set <span class="process-math">\(\{x^2-x,x-1\}\)</span> is also independent, since neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other. Therefore, this set is a basis, and <span class="process-math">\(\dim U_2=2\text{.}\)</span></p>

<li>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(p(x)=p(-x)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> is an even polynomial, and therefore <span class="process-math">\(p(x)=a+bx^2\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(a,b\in\R\text{.}\)</span> (If you didn't know this it's easily verified: if</p>

<p class="continuation">we can immediately cancel <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from each side, and since <span class="process-math">\((-x)^2=x^2\text{,}\)</span> we can cancel <span class="process-math">\(cx^2\)</span> as well.

<p>It follows that the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1,x^2\}\)</span> spans <span class="process-math">\(U_3\text{,}\)</span> and since this is a subset of the standard basis <span class="process-math">\(\{1,x,x^2\}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{,}\)</span> it must be independent, and is therefore a basis of <span class="process-math">\(U_3\text{,}\)</span> letting us conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\dim U_3=2\text{.}\)</span></p>
